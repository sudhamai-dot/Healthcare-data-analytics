Healthcare Metrics Aggregation & Tableau Analytics
Project Overview
End-to-end healthcare data aggregation and analysis using SQL (Google BigQuery) with Tableau visualization. Aggregated state-level healthcare metrics, calculated averages and rankings, and created analytical tables to support standardized comparison and operational insights. Final dataset is optimized for reporting and interactive dashboards.

Tools & Skills
- SQL & Google BigQuery
- Tableau
- Healthcare Analytics
- Data Cleaning & Validation
- Aggregation Functions (AVG, COUNT)
- GROUP BY / ORDER BY
- Ranking & Analytical Tables
- Pivoting / Data Reshaping for Visualization

Methodology
1. Cleaned data: Removed null and invalid metric values from the dataset.
2. Aggregated metrics: Calculated average metric values for each state, metric type, and year.
3. Ranked states: Assigned rankings within each metric type to identify top-performing states.
4. Pivoted data: Reshaped dataset so each metric is a separate column for Tableau visualization.
5. Final dataset: Calculated overall rankings using composite metrics for reporting and decision support.

Outcome
- Cleaned and validated dataset ready for Tableau visualization.  
- Analytical tables with averages and rankings for standardized performance comparison across states.  
- Tableau dashboard highlights trends, rankings, and actionable insights for clinical and operational decision-making.
